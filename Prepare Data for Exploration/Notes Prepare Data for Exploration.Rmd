# Abstract  
Here you will find the notes for the third course of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. There are 5 other courses in the sequence. These are the key topics.  

- How data is generated  
- Different formats, types, and structures of data  
- Analyze data for bias and credibility  
- What data analysts refer to as "clean data"  
- Database Basics, SQL  
- Extract your own data using Spreadsheets and SQL  
- The basics of data organization  
- The process of protecting your data, encryption/tokenization

# Week 1: Introduct to Data Exploration
## How Data is Collected
- Interviews  
- Observations  
- Forms  
- Questionnaires  
- Surveys  
- Online Cookies  

## Data Collection Considerations
- How the data will be collected  
- What data sources  
- Decide what data to use  
- How much data to collect  
- Select the right type of data  
- Determine the time frame  

## Discover Data Formats
Discrete Data: Quantitative Data that is given in specific intervals.  
Continuous Data: Quantitative Data is can be written in any which way.  
Nominal Data: Unorganized Qualitative Data  
Ordinal Data: A type of Qualitative Data with a set order or scale  
Internal Data: Data that lives in a companies' own system  
External Data: Data that is generated outside of an organization  
Structured Data: Data organized in certain formats such as rows and columns, like spreadsheets or databases  
Unstructued Data: Data that is not organized in an easily or identifiable manner, like video/audio files

## Data Modeling Levels
Conceptual Data Modeling: Gives a high-level view of your data structure, such as how you want data to interact across an organization  
Logical Data Modeling: Focuses on the technical details of the model, such as relationships, attributes, and entities  
Physical Data Modeling: Depicts how the database was built. Explains how the databases, applications, and features will interact in specific detail  

## Data-Modeling techniques
Entity Relation Diagram (ERD) and Unified Modeling Language (UML)

## Wide vs. Long Data
Wide: Time is listed as columns, usually displayed 'wide'  
- Preferred when creating tables and charts with few variables  
- Helpful when comparing straightforward line graphs  
Long: Time is listed as entries, usually displayed 'long'  
- Preferred when storing a lot of variable within each subject  
- Helpful when performing advanced statistical analysis or graphing  

## Week 2: Ensuring Data Integrity

# Types of Bias
1. Sampling Bias  
    Tendency to over sample one demographic over another  
2. Observer Bias  
    Tendency for different people to observe things differently  
3. Interpretation Bias  
    Tendency to interpret ambiguous situations in a positive or negative way  
4. Confirmation Bias  
    Tendency to search for or interpret information that reconfirms pre-existing beliefs  
    
# Identifying good data sources  
Good data will follow the acronym R.O.C.C.C  
- R: Reliable  
- O: Original Data Source  
- C: Comprehensive  
- C: Current  
- C: Cited  

# Aspects of Data Ethics  
- Ownership  
  - Individuals own their own raw data  
- Transaction Transparency  
  - Data processing activities and algorithms should be completely explainable and understood by the individual who provides their data  
- Consent  
  - An individual's right to know how and why their data is being used/collected  
- Currency  
  - Individuals should be aware of financial transactions resulting from the use of their data and the scale of these transactions  
- Privacy  
  - Preserving a data subject's information and activity any time a data transaction occurs  
- Openness  
  - Free access, usage, and sharing of data  

## Week 3: All About Databases  
What is metadata? Data about data.  
Why use metadata? It puts data into context. Helps to keep data consistent and uniform.  

# 3 Common Types of metadata    
1. Descriptive  
  Metadata that describes a piece of data and can be used to identify it at a later point in time  
2. Structural  
   Metadata that indicates how a piece of data is organized and whether it is part of one, or more than one, data collection  
3. Administrative  
  Metadata that indicates the technical source of a digital asset and it's details

# Metadata Repositories  
- Describes the state and location of the metadata  
- Describes the structures of the tables inside  
- Describes how the data flows through the repository  
- Keeps track of who accesses the metadata and when

## Week 4: Organizing and Protecting Your Data  
# Benefits of Organizing Your Data  
- Makes it easier to find and use  
- Helps you avoid making mistakes during your analysis  
- Helps to protect your data  

# Best Practices when Organizing Data  
- Naming Conventions  
  - Consistent guidelines that describe the content, date, or version of a file in its name  
  - Use logical and descriptive names for your files to make them easier to find and use  
- Foldering  
  - Organizing your files into folders  
  - Break folders down into subfolders  
- Archiving Older Files  
  - Moving old files to a separate location  
- Align your naming and storage practices with your team  
- Develop metadata practices  

# File Naming DO's  
- Work out your conventions early  
- Align file naming with your team  
- make sure file names are meaningful  
- Keep file names short  
- Format dates YYYYMMDD: SalesReport20201125  
- Lead revision numbers with 0: SalesReport20201125v02  
- Use hypens, underscords, or capitalized letters: SalesReport_2020_11_25_v02
